# 4. 	Create a list of thousand number using range and xrange 
# and see the difference between each other.

list=[*range(1,1001)]
print(list)

# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, 
# starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), 
# and stops before a specified number.

# xrange() is used only in Python 2. x whereas range() is used in Python 3. x.

#The onlu difference is that the range returns the list object where as the 
# xrange returns the x range object.
