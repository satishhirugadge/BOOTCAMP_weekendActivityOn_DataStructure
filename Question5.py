# 5. 	How Tuple is beneficial as compare to the list?

# The difference between the tuple and the list are :
# Tuple are immutable --i.e we cnnot change the data,
# that is why very less inbuild function are applicable on the tuple.
# The tuple shoild be used when we know that the data is not to be changed : For eg:Months.

# List are mutable ==i.e it can be changed and has many build in function.

# THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT TUPLES ARE FASTER THAN THE LIST HENCE SHOULD BE USED WHEREEVER NECESSARY.
